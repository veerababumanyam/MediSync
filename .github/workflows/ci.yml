# MediSync Main CI Workflow
#
# Runs on all pushes to main and pull requests.
# Validates code quality, tests, and i18n compliance.
#
# Jobs:
# - lint: ESLint + TypeScript type checking
# - test: Vitest unit tests
# - i18n: Translation validation (calls i18n-check workflow)
# - build: Production build verification
