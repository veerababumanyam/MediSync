## 🛠️ Developer Tools
- **Node.js**: `24.x LTS` (Krypton - Required for stability/tooling)
- **NPM**: `10.x+`
- **Docker**: Version 25+ recommended
- **Makefile**: Standard BSD/GNU Make

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Frontend**: Prioritize the **Tailwind CSS v4** upgrade. The new engine significantly reduces build times and simplifies configuration.
2. **Infrastructure**: Schedule a migration for **PostgreSQL 18.2**. While v16 is stable, v18 offers critical optimizations for the scale of data MediSync handles.
3. **Monitoring**: The jump from **Prometheus 2.x to 3.x** is significant. This should be tested thoroughly in a staging environment before production rollout.
4. **Security**: Keeping **Keycloak** updated to v26.x is essential for maintaining the latest security patches and identity protocols.
